This project contains the Typescript that generates the St. Paul's Lenexa UMC Choir Calendar sync. It takes information
from the choir spreadsheet and adds it to the choir calendar. While it is specific to that particular spreadsheet, the
code can serve as a template for how to take information from a spreadsheet with a date column and turn it into a 
calendar entry.

These instructions are meant to help you orient to the development environment.
They are not exhaustive but can be used as guidelines.
